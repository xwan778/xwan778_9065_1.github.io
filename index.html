	<p>For cat lovers, there’s no doubt about cats’ ability to relieve people’s daily stress. Cats with their fluffy fur and soft meows are definitely good for our mental health and heal us from daily stress. In fact, cats have been identified in studies as supportive pets by decreasing stress, offering companionship, purring the pain away, and serving as a therapy animal.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Whether a person suffers from mental health issues or not, developing a relationship with an animal can be beneficial. When you are working or studying, knowing that your furry little guy is waiting for you at home can make you look forward to life. In addition, it can also combat loneliness. Cat's closeness, purring and naps are all secrets to boosting happiness.</p>
